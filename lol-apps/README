Overview of applications:

* SymmSHE.hs gives an implementation of a symmetric-key,
  somewhat-homomorphic encryption scheme that is essentially
  equivalent to the one from the toolkit paper [LPR'13].

* KeyHomomorphicPRF.hs gives an implementation of the
  key-homomorphic pseudo-random function from Banerjee
  and Peikert in Crypto 2014 ([BP14]).

* HomomPRF provides an interface for the homomorphic evaluation of the [BP14]
  PRF.

Note that an example using each application can be found in the 'examples'
directory.
